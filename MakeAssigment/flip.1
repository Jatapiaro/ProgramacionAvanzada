NAME
       flip â do newline conversions between **IX and MSâDOS

SYNOPSIS
       flip âh
       flip âumvtsbz file ...

DESCRIPTION
       Flip  is  a  file  interchange  program that converts text
file formats
       between	**IX  and  MSâDOS.  It converts lines ending with
carriageâreturn
       (CR)  and  linefeed  (LF)   to	lines  ending  with  just
linefeed, or vice
       versa.

       Flip has the following features.

       o       If  a  file  contains isolated CR  characters  for
underlining  or
	      overprinting, flip does not change them.

       o      When  asked to convert a file to	the  same  format
that it already
	      has,  flip causes no change to the file.	 Thus  to
convert  all
	      files to **IX format you can type

		 flip âu *.*  (under MSâDOS)
		 flip âu *    (under **IX)

	    and  all  files will  end  up  right,  regardless  of
whether they were
	    in MSâDOS or in **IX format to begin with.	This also
works in the
	    opposite direction.

       o    Flip preserves file  timestamps.   You  can  override
this.

       o    Flip  is  written in C and will compile and run under
MSâDOS/Turbo
	    C, 4.3BSD, and System V.

       o    Flip accepts wildcards and multiple filenames on  the
command line.

       o     If   a   user   interrupt	aborts	Flip, it does not
leave behind any
	    garbage files or cause corruption of the files  being
converted.

       o     Flip  will  normally refuse to convert binary files.
You can  overâ
	    ride this.

       o    When  converting  from   MSâDOS   to   **IX   format,
flip removes any
	    trailing control Z (the last character in the  file),
but  leaves
	    embedded  control Z characters unchanged.  This mini‐
mizes the posâ
	    sibility  of  accidentally	converting  a binary file
that contains  a
	    control  Z near the beginning.  You can override this
and ask flip
	    to	 recognize   the   first   control   Z	found  as
endâofâfile.

       o    Flip can be asked to strip the high (parity)  bit  as
it converts  a
	    file.

       Flip is normally invoked as:

	    flip âumhvtb file ...


       One   of âu, âm, or âh is required.  Switches may be given
separately or
       combined together after a dash.	For  example,  the  three
command  lines
       given below are equivalent:

	    flip âuvt *.c
	    flip âu âv ât *.c
	    flip âu âvt *.c

       The meanings of the switches are as follows.

       âu      convert	to  **IX  format (CR LF => LF, lone CR or
LF unchanged,
	      trailing control Z removed, embedded control Z  un‐
changed)

       âm     convert to MSâDOS format (lone LF => CR LF, lone CR
unchanged)

       âh     give a help message

       âv     be verbose, print filenames as they are processed

       ât     touch files (donât preserve timestamps)

       âs     strip high bit

       âb     convert binary files too	(else  binary  files  are
left unchanged)

       âz     truncate file at first control Z encountered

       On  systems  that allow a program to know  its  own  name,
flip  may  be
       renamed	(or  linked)  to a file called toix (or  toix.exe
under MSâDOS)
       for  conversion	to **IX format, or to a file called  toms
(or  toms.exe
       under  MSâDOS)  for conversion to MSâDOS format.  When in‐
voked with the
       name  toix  or  toms,  flip will act as if it were invoked
with the  âu  or
       âm option respectively.
